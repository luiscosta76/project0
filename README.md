For this project0 I chose to do a website for my former band "You can't win, Charlie Brown", who were looking for someone to build them a new website. So this will be the live website using once I transfer it to their server.

Here's a short description of the files:

nav.html - contains the code for Bootstrap's sticky navigation bar, which is injected into every page using jquery
footer.html - simple footer with icons and links to the band's social media; it's also injected into every page
index.html - homepage
music.html - a page with all their albums online from spotify and soundcloud, where the visitor can stream directly any of the songs. Built with Bootstrap's responsive grid system
videos.html - a page with a Bootstrap carousel displaying all of their videos and some additional information for each of them
about.html - simple
contact.html - a contact page also using bootstrap's grid system and forms. The form will be able to send emails once it's moved to the production server with php installed
styles.scss / styles.css - custom stylesheet for the site
form.js - javascript file with the necessary code to validate the contact form and send the email
handler.php - php file for sending the emails
