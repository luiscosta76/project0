For this project0 I chose to do a website for my former band "You can't win, Charlie Brown", who were looking for someone to build them a new website. This will be their live website once they send me some information that is missing for the home and about page, and the files are transfered to their server.

Here's a short description of the files:

nav.html - contains the code for Bootstrap's sticky navigation bar, which is injected into every page using jquery
footer.html - simple footer with icons and links to the band's social media; it's also injected into every page
index.html - homepage, currently using the facebook widget do display their facebook page events. This will probably be changed since this widget doesn't seem to work on Firefox
music.html - a page with all their albums online from spotify and soundcloud, where the visitor can stream directly any of the songs. Built with Bootstrap's responsive grid system
videos.html - a page with a Bootstrap carousel displaying all of their videos and some additional information for each of them
about.html - simple
contact.html - a contact page also using bootstrap's grid system and forms. The form will be able to send emails once it's moved to the production server with php installed
styles.scss / styles.css - custom stylesheet for the site
form.js - javascript file with the necessary code to validate the contact form and send the email
handler.php - php file for sending the emails
